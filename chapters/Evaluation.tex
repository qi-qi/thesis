\section{Experimental Testbed}
\label{sec:testbed}

The MySQL Cluster consists of six data nodes connected by 1 Gigabit LAN. Each data node has an Intel Xeon X5660 CPU at 2.80GHz, and contributes 6 GB RAM (5 GB Data Memory + 1 GB Index Memory), therefore, the total available memory for the cluster is 36 GB. The number of data replica is 2. The maximum concurrent transactions is 10000 for each data node, and the inactive timeout for each transaction is 5 seconds. 

\noindent To avoid any communication overhead caused by RPC connections and serialization, we run the NameNode and Clients on the same machine with Intel i7-4770T CPU at 2.50GHz and 16 GB RAM. This machine is connected with the MySQL Cluster data nodes by 100 Megabits LAN.
