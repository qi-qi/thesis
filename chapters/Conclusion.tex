\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we first analyze the limitation in HDFS NameNode implementation and provide an overview of Hop-HDFS illustrating how we overcome those problems. 

\noindent Second, we give a systematic assessment on precedent works for Hop-HDFS comparing to HDFS, and also analyze the restriction when using pessimistic locking mechanisms to ensure the strong consistency semantics.

\noindent Third, based on the investigation of current shortcomings, we provide a solution based on Optimistic Concurrency Control with Snapshot Isolation on Semantic Related Group to improve the throughput performance in the NamNode while maintaining the strong consistent semantics.

\noindent Finally, as a proof of concept, the evaluation shows that our solution outperforms the previous work of Hop-HDFS up to 70 \%. The correctness of our implementation has been validated by 300+ Apache HDFS unit tests passing.

\section{Future Work}

Based on the same idea of our solution, other operations, like \textit{create, rename} in the NameNode can also adopt the approach to improve the throughput.
